<h2 align="center">50 Week code challenge</h2>
<p>
  
  Here I set a challenge for myself by creating a landing page 1 week 1 landing page, up to approximately 50 landing pages. <br>I might use a website design that has been provided by previous learning websites such as [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home), [devChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/), [Frontend Dev](https://www.frontendpro.dev/), [UI Design Daily](https://uidesigndaily.com/), [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/), [Codewell](https://www.codewell.cc/) And many others. <br>
Hopefully with this I can increase my experience and insight in creating landing pages.</p>
